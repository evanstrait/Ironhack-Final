# Final Project: Twitter Blue Launch

* Project Proposal

"Parody Accounts and Stock Valuation"

My final project visualizes how the stock market was impacted by Twitter Blue's recent launch of accounts being verified for $8. Using Twitter and Yahoo Finance data, I will find correlation between Tweets posted by parody accounts with Blue Checkmarks, and illustrate how they coincided with the valuation of major corporations on the stock market. I will then build interactive data visualizations using Tableau.
