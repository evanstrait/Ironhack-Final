# Final Project: Twitter Blue Launch

* Project Proposal

Parody Accounts and Stock Value

Visualizing the impact on the stock market of Twitter Blue's recent launch of accounts being verified for $8. Using open Twitter and Yahoo Finance data, I will find correlation between Tweets posted by parody accounts with Blue Checkmarks, and illustrate how they coincided with the valuation of major corporations on the stock market. I will then build interactive data visualizations using Tableau.
